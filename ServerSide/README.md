# Files for your host

This folder contains php files to host in your server if you want to implement some features like:
- update from Mega
- report errors
- count downloads and monitor new versions' diffusion

Thery are not required if you use GitLab to distribute updates and you do not want to implement any one of the features listed above.

These php files communicate with a MySQL server whose tables can be created with the query contained in _initialise.sql_
